## Me, You, Him/Her and Jobs

### 1. Jobs

We use the same pattern we use to introduce ourselves:
Watashi wa … desu.

- Gakusei (Student)
- Sensei/Kyoshi (Teacher)
- Kaishain (Employee, you hear a lot of this word because it covers too much.)
- İsha (Doctor)
- Kangofu (Nurse)
- Enjinia (Engineer)
- Bengoshi (Lawyer)
- Kutsuya (Shoemaker, it is enough to bring the “ya” attachment to the end of the word.)
- Meganeya (Optician)
- Yaoya (Greengrocer)

### 2. Personal pronouns

- Watashi -> Me
- Anata -> You
- Kare -> Him
- Kanojo -> Her
- Watashitachi -> We
- Anatatachi -> They
- Karera -> They (men)
- Kanojotachi -> They (girls)

End of name attachments:

…san -> for older people
…chan -> for little girl
…kun -> for little boy
But the use of spoken language in japan may not be exactly this way, irrespective of age. For Example:

…san -> friendly female friends talking
…kun -> friendly male friends talking

I’m Esra Nur Soylu. I graduated from Sakarya University Computer Engineering. I’m working as a **SOC T2 Analyst**. Feeling like I’m working with a hobby(cyber searching) but also making money that’s a perfect feeling, really… I’m also dealing with **game programming**. 

I have a PRODAFT / INVICTUS DKHOS certificate.

**Ninjutsu** is a philosophy and sport that I have maintained for 2 years.

I guess that’s all for now…

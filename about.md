I’m Esra Nur Soylu. I graduated from Sakarya University Computer Engineering. I was involved in game development and website development while at university. I continued the industry by working both on the SOC side and on the pentester side. Thanks to this blog, I both take note of my research for myself and hope it will be a useful resource for everyone.

I have OSCP Certificate.

**Ninjutsu** is a philosophy and sport that I have maintained for 2 years.

Additionally, I love to participate in CTF competitions.

I guess that’s all for now…
